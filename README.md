# LoRa on Track

The project is about SAFETY and FUN with additional options to manage waste collection. How? By introducting a LoRa based Hadrware/Software devices system able to send emergency signals with geolocation to the Rescue units. The system is dedicated to tourists offices and cities all around the world to use without the need of connection to GSM or Wi-Fi networks. With the use of LoRa we should be able to cover a long-range communication and cover a wide area, especially in remote places where there is no GSM coverage.
We designed a system consisting of a main station, and "checkpoints" placed on the tourist track. The tourist can rent a handheld, battery powered LoRa device, with GSM tracker. When emergency occurs the tourist can press a special "emergency button" on the device for sending emergency signal and GPS coordinates. In addition each device is equipped with a simple LCD display for informing about wheather conditions or in case danger - informing the tourist that the track is closed. 
Each checkpoint will send information about the weather (temperature and humidity) and some additional info for example - whether the garbage bin is full and need to be collected.
The fun part is that every checpoint will have a short-range Wi-Fi access point, and when the tourist will approach the checkpoint he/she will receive and award (confirmation of achiving a checkpoint). This should enable tourists to collect rewards from the tourist office. 
The system is dedicated to be used by everyone, including families, sportsmen. As the extension of the system the same devices could be used by rescue teams or firefighters in remote places.
